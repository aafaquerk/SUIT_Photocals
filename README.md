PhotoCalibration of SUIT Payload On Aditya
==========================================

This project is to develop a IDL based GUI Photo-calibrate SUIT files. Various componenet level response files will be input and telescope response will the primary output. This is very specifically designed corresponding to SUIT instrument components. But can be easily tweeked to create any optical telescope photo-calibration software.
